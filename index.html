		<h4>
			My work ranges from concepts of social issues to captivating senses while exploring the realm of emotional or entertaining aesthetics to further cultivate my style as an artist.
			I aim to approach communicating one's or personal experiences through stories or feelings that create the purpose for me to inspire.
			On one hand, some of the art that I make include sentimental messages as well as personal topics that I think would shed light on society and culture.
			On the other hand, I also make many pieces that highlight pure entertainment.
			With references in pop culture to aesthetic graphics, I think gives off my representation as both artist and person.
			With explorations into different mediums in the space of digital media, my work as a whole consists of the juxtaposition between the relationship of cultural and societal thought versus the relationship of color, interactivity, and audience experience. 

		</h4>
		<h4>    
			As I started developing and entering the field of digital art, I have opened a new realm of possibilities and have yet to experiment with the many ideas I plan to explore in the future.
			However, I have been able to learn more about storytelling and user experience and how to express myself through my art.
			With the help of peers, professors, and mentors, I have built more confidence in the projects I create.
			One of the most important knowledge that I have gained while experiencing DMA is the skill of mixing media. 
			The importance of diversifying your knowledge and skill set will allow an artist to grow and that is what I am trying to better myself at.
		</h4>
		<h4>
			While on my journey to finding my style as an artist, digital media has opened my mind to how I can express the messages and topics I want to talk about. 
			From the beginning of Fall 2020, I can tell now that I have grown drastically as an artist and my way of thinking about art, specifically art in digital media, has changed for the better.
			I am now on the hunt to learn, develop, and enhance more skills for which I can create with.
