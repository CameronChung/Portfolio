			My work ranges from concepts of social issues to captivating senses while exploring the realm of emotional or entertaining aesthetics to further cultivate my style as an artist. Considering inspiration from Emma Goldman to Yayoi Kusama, new approaches of communicating one's or personal experiences through stories or feelings create the purpose for me to inspire. On one end, some of the art that I make include sentimental messages as well as serious topics that I think should be brought more into the inner social sphere conversation, thus shedding light on the fact that different instances should be talked about more so we can learn from them and improve upon as a collective society and or culture. On the other hand, I also make many pieces that highlight the entertainment factor amongst the audience. With references in pop culture to aesthetic graphics that many people will find cute, I think gives the ultimate representation of me as both an artist and a person. With different explorations into different mediums in the space of digital media, my work as a whole consists of the juxtaposition between the relationship of cultural and societal thought versus the relationship of color and audio aesthetics as pure entertainment.

			My love of art ranges from different styles like watercolor and pointillism, as I started developing and entering the field of digital art, I have opened a new realm of possibilities and have yet to experiment with the many ideas I plan to do in the future. However, since my transition, I have been able to learn more about color concept as well as storytelling and conveying through these fundamentals into some of the pieces I have been able to create. With the help of peers, professors, and mentors, I have built more confidence in the projects I create for example, web code. From my first semester at San Jose State, HTML and CSS code was a foreign language to me and I lacked all confidence in myself to understand the concept and the process of building web pages, however, since then, I have been practicing more and more and have seen myself improve in the understanding of its concepts. This aligns with my view on videography and video editing. Even though I have only entered shallow waters within these areas, I have felt more inspired by doing more of it. One of the most important basic skills I have integrated more often now is the idea of mixing medias. All throughout my learning career, I was always told do make art a certain way and through one path that coordinates with it. Comparing it to my first college year experience, it is encouraged for me to mix up and use different medias all together even within one piece. When building something up through a certain program, doesnâ€™t mean others are off limits. Breaking down these notions of just using one medium is a challenge. I plan to explore even more and try crossing different medias within each other.

			While on my journey to finding my style as an artist, digital media is the vessel in which I will use to hone and add skills under my belt. Just from the beginning of Fall 2020, I can tell that I have grown drastically as an artist and my way of thinking about art, specifically art in digital media, has changed for the better. I am now on the hunt to learn more, developing and enhancing more skills to which I can create with is one of the many goals I am striving towards now. In taking that next step into the DMA BFA, it allows for me to step into a new ocean of ideas, skills, and experiences that I am eager to learn more about.
