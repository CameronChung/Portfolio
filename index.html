		<h4>
			I have embarked on a transformative journey over the past couple of years, delving into the never-ending realm of digital media. 
			Embracing the digital canvas as my medium, I find myself immersed in a dynamic design of pixels, a symphony of code and color that echoes to the audience. 
			Through this digital lens, I strive to capture my voice through art.
		</h4>
		<h4>    
			The pursuit of an artistic identity has become my personal battleground, a constant dialogue between self-expression and the influences that shape that creative tendency. 
			Drawing inspiration from Yayoi Kusama's uniqueness, many aspects of her work inspire me to explore new processes in art making. 
			Kusama: "Our earth is only one polka dot among a million stars in the cosmos." 
			Each digital stroke is a dot in my cosmos, describing the ongoing evolution of my creative expression.
		</h4>
		<h4>
			My digital creations emerge from the idea between emotion and experience. 
			Each brushstroke, pixel, or line of code is a testament to the ongoing struggle to define my artistic signature, a process that mirrors the quest for meaning and identity. 
			In this digital age, where the boundaries of artistic expression are constantly evolving, I navigate different possibilities, experimenting with various mediums to sculpt my vision. 
			I invite the viewer to join me on a contemplative journey through chaos and order.
