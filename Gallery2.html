<h4>
    "Fragile Dreams" is a digital installation in a virtual art gallery (New Art City) made within the Cadre Mentorship Program. With the help of Raymond Lam and Cindy Tran, we were able to create a tribute piece for the Late Qing Han known as QuinniArt on Instagram. Her work inspired hundreds of thousands of people around the world. My mentorship pairing wanted to give this piece a new platform to further spread her love of art. Preserving her original design, we created an interactive web page to experience the full scope of scenses with Quinni's work. Below are the accessable works to the interactive website as well as the New Art City mentorship gallery for an immersive 3D experience.

<h4>
    "Two Aliens at the End of The World" is an experimental piece that took in audio interviews I conducted with friends and manipulated to make it sound like the voices of different aliens. With similar feelings of a podcast, I used the audio with a simple digital drawing to convey what it would be like to be there as the recording was happening. With the naturalistic ambient background sound, it gives a sense of a natural scenery as you listen to two distinct alien like voices having a conversation.
