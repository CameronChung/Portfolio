<h4>This video is a visual and sensational experience that demonstrates the view point of a women walking alone through various times of the night. With raw images and audio, you too experience it with the character. The dangers of being a women in society is starting to bring to light the topic of conversation within social and mass media. Filming this in my own day to day life opens my eyes to the never ending caution women have to keep while out in public. This is my representation and interpretation of women's everyday lives.</h4>

    "Fragile Dreams" is a digital installation in a virtual art gallery (New Art City) made within the Cadre Mentorship Program. With the help of Raymond Lam and Cindy Tran, we were able to create a tribute piece for the Late Qing Han known as QuinniArt on Instagram. Her work inspired hundreds of thousands of people around the world. My mentorship pairing wanted to give this piece a new platform to further spread her love of art. Preserving her original design, we created an interactive web page to experience the full scope of scenses with Quinni's work. Below are the accessable works to the interactive website as well as the New Art City mentorship gallery for an immersive 3D experience.
