<h4>This video is a visual and sensational experience that demonstrates the view point of a women walking alone through various times of the night. With raw images and audio, you too experience it with the character. The dangers of being a women in society is starting to bring to light the topic of conversation within social and mass media. Filming this in my own day to day life opens my eyes to the never ending caution women have to keep while out in public. This is my representation and interpretation of women's everyday lives.</h4>

<br>
<br>
<h4>
    "Two Aliens at the End of The World" is an experimental piece that took in audio interviews I conducted with friends and manipulated to make it sound like the voices of different aliens. With similar feelings of a podcast, I used the audio with a simple digital drawing to convey what it would be like to be there as the recording was happening. With the naturalistic ambient background sound, it gives a sense of a natural scenery as you listen to two distinct alien like voices having a conversation.

<br>
<br>
 <h4>
    "Lost in Space" is a motion graphic that tells the story behind a lost robot on a routine maintenance run as a janitorial robot. Starting out as a hand drawn digital painting, enhancing it in after effects was always my main goal. I wanted this piece to show as an animation and hopefully become a full animation. With this thirty second trailer, I want to build onto the story for my robot as I further refine my editing and videography skills.
