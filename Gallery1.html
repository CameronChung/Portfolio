<p>"Consumption", 2020, Photoshop and Sublime Text Editor</p>
<br>

<h4>"Consumption" is a collage glitched in Sublime Text Editor and further refined in Adobe photoshop. This piece was made to represent the digital culture in which we live in today. The consumption of social media in turn cosumes us. With the popularity of different platforms, it affects our society, culture, and the way we view others and life itself. What becomes important is up to the users yet the control has been skewed. We as social media users are now being taken control of. No matter good or bad, social media will have consequences that play out in reality. It will just depend on how you bring it into reality.</h4>

<p>"The middle of everywhere", 2020, photoshop</p>
<br>
<h4>"The Middle of Everywhere" is a collection of image captures inside the game "Sky: The Children of Light". The expansion of photography amongst other fields like video games allow for a new style to emerge. My collection shows the moments where scenic environments show a different type of beauty. Typically, the colors give off a tone to which the viewer develops a mood for it but when that aspect is tampered with or changes to its opposite, what does it feel like then? My three images experience that of a changed view on the beauty of environment; what happens when you start feeling fear, sorrow, anxiety etc.?</h4>
